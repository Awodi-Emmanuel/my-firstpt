    <h2> A PROGAMMER HAS NO LIFE</h2> 
        
    my experience to be a developer 
    i heard a lot people said things like a programmer<br>
    has no life so i was now wondering how that was possible<br>
    I later realize the kind of life they were talking about and fully <br>know now that being a programmer is not an easy task like my teacher do said to us way back is a herculean task!
